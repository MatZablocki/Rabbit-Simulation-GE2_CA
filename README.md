#Simulation of rabbit behaviours in a small open field.

The rabbits eat grass when theyre hungry, when theyre full they will breed. When the player approaches them, they will flee 
towards the nearest bush. If they dont get food for a set amount of time they will starve.

- I studied rabbit behaviour by observing them and by studying rabbit running images to see how they run.
  I have been observing rabbits for years on the field where i walk my dog everyday. I found that rabbits mostly sit still
  but when they sense you approaching they run to the nearest bush.
- My simulation is similar to these comparisons as this is the behaviour i implemented. My build works faster however as its
  unrealistic to wait for rabbits to reproduce, and this is not something i have obsereved before as rabbits like privacy.
